write a script to play an animation for an object
Sure, here's an example script for playing an animation on an object using Unity's animation system:

csharp
Copy code
using UnityEngine;

public class PlayAnimation : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Animation anim; // Reference to the Animation component on the object
    public string animationName; // Name of the animation clip to play

    private void Start()
    {
        // Make sure the animation component is assigned
        if (anim == null)
        {
            anim = GetComponent<Animation>();
        }
    }

    private void Update()
    {
        // Check for input to trigger the animation
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space))
        {
            // If the animation is already playing, stop it first
            if (anim.isPlaying)
            {
                anim.Stop();
            }

            // Play the animation clip
            anim.Play(animationName);
        }
    }
}
This script assumes that you have an Animation component attached to the object that you want to animate, and that you have created an animation clip with the name animationName. You can change the name of the animation clip and the input key to trigger the animation to whatever you want.

To use this script, attach it to the object that you want to animate, and assign the anim variable to the Animation component on the object. You can also assign the animationName variable to the name of the animation clip that you want to play.

When you run the game, you can press the spacebar (or whatever input key you've chosen) to play the animation. The script checks if the animation is already playing, and stops it before playing it again to avoid any glitches or overlapping animations.
